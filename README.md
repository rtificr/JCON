SRON stands for Saksham Rapid Object Notation.<br/> <br/>
It is a blazingly fast, heavily optimized, dynamically typed, single threaded, lightweight, functional and compiled + interpreted programming language.
It follows the typing style of JSON. In this, every line specifies an attribute which shows what types of instruction is written after colon(:).

```bash
{
    name: MAIN
    comment : A Sample Code to print something on terminal.
    0 : println("Hello, SRON")    
}
```

The SRON's compiler converts the source code into a bytecode and saves it in a .srb file.
The .srb file is further executed by SRON Interpreter.
